         <p>VICE is a simple chess program made in C, detailed in nearly 100 videos on YouTube. You can see the details <a href="http://www.bluefever.net/Downloads/ViceReadMe.html" target="_blank" >here</a></p>
         <p>As a nice little side project, VICE now plays in 'correspondence style' via Twitter! (I hope)
         <p/>
         <p>It's running on a Raspberry Pi 2
         <p/>
         <p>It's in very early stages of development - in other words, it's been tested just by me, so expect odd things to happen now and again.</p>
         <p>
            Feel free to DM me at the Twitter Handle

         </p>
         <p>Important - the first message from a new source (you) has to be manually accepted - the Twitter API doesn't seem to have this (as far as I can tell). So there could be a wait to get a reply when you first ever send Vice a message.</p>
         <div class="page-header">
            <h2>How it works</h2>
         </div>
         <p>You can play games with Vice using Messaging on Twitter - you send it commands / moves, and it (hopfully) replies.</p>
         <div class="page-header">
            <h3>The commands:</h3>
         </div>
         <div class="panel panel-primary">
            <div class="panel-heading">new game</div>
            <div class="panel-body">This will start a new game between you and Vice. Colour chosen randomly. If you are in a game, Vice should tell you and send you the board</div>
         </div>
         <div class="panel panel-primary">
            <div class="panel-heading">status</div>
            <div class="panel-body">Vice will send you info on the current game you are playing, if you are. if not, it will let you know.</div>
         </div>
         <div class="panel panel-primary">
            <div class="panel-heading">resign</div>
            <div class="panel-body">Resign the current game. Make a little chess engine happy.</div>
         </div>
         <div class="panel panel-primary">
            <div class="panel-heading">move xxxx</div>
            <div class="panel-body">
               <p>Make a move - it MUST be in the form e7e8q - e7 is the from square, e8 the to sqaure, and in the case of a promotion, q = queen, n = knight, r = rook, b = bishop.</p>
               <p>For Example:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>start of the game, move the e pawn two sqaures <i>@ChessVice move e2e4</i></li>
                  <li>Castle kingside white - <i>@ChessVice move e1g1</i></li>
                  <li>promote a pawn to a bishop (as black) - <i>@ChessVice move b2b1b</i></li>
               </ul>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div class="page-header">
            <h3>Illegal Moves</h3>
         </div>
         <p>If Vice doesn't understand your move, it will let you know</p>
         <div class="page-header">
            <h3>End of game</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Vice **should** correctly adjudicate draws, mates, fifty move draws, low material draws and stalemates</p>
         <div class="page-header">
            <h3>Processing Commands</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Vice will process the command, BUT NOT ALWAYS INSTANTLY - but usually within 30 minutes or so. Any more than that and it means it's overloaded, or broken. The former would be nice, the latter a high probability</p>
         <p>Why is this? Well, it loads tweets at regular intervals - usually every 10 minutes or so. It then looks at the moves, thinks about them, and sends the reply. Better would be to get tweets <b>as they are sent</b> - and indeed, there is a streaming API from Twitter that does just this. Vice works with the streaming API, but I need to refine it still so it doesn't block (in the case of many moves - again a nice problem to have). Streaming will come in the near future.</p>
         <p>Here's a view from a game in progress..</p>
         <img src="messages.png"></img>
        <!--  <div class="page-header">
            <h3>What is the [Code: xxxx] at the end of tweets from Vice? (important!!)</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Twitter doesn't allow repeat tweets within a certain timeframe (or other rule, I can't figure it out). This can cause issues, for example, if you send new game, resign a few hours later, and send new game again, you might be told by twitter you can't. The same applies to vice - it might send you e2e4 as a move, and then the next game the same. And the tweet wouldn't work, due to a repeat</p>
         <p>So, as a complete hack, I add a random number onto the end of each tweet, to avoid the duplication issue. This might break a rule, but I'm sure someone will be in touch if it does! (and it's not as if I'm abusing the twitter data api or something)</p> -->

            <h3>Final Word</h3>
         </div>
         <p>This is a hobby, for enjoyment. Don't get too mad if things break. </p>
         <div class="page-header">
            <h3>You Tube</h3>
         </div>
         <p>A lot of people seemed to like the series I did on making Vice, so I might try and do the same for this app. We'll see.</p>

            <h3>Brief 'How Does It Work'</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The bot consists of:</p>
         <ul style="margin-bottom: 80px;" >
            <li>
               Some python(3) modules for:
               <ul>
                  <li>The twitter API (using twython)</li>
                  <li>Refereeing the game (understanding moves, game state)</li>
                  <li>Starting the thinking engine process (which is a separate program) and communicating using Pipes</li>
                  <li>Drawing images of the board</li>
                  <li>Reading and writing from a MySQL database</li>
                  <li>Sending me emails to let me know what's going on when I'm not looking</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A MySql database to keep track of game state and processed tweets</li>
            <li>The Vice engine itself, written in C</li>
            <li>A headless Raspberry Pi with Raspbian Lite</li>
         </ul>
